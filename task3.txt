Theme: Harry Potter & the Chamber of Data
Problem Title: Predict the Sorting Hat’s Choice using Hogwarts Student Data
Background Story
The Sorting Hat has lost its magical powers and needs your help! Every year at Hogwarts, new students arrive, but without the hat’s judgment, no one knows whether they belong to Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.
Your task is to train an intelligent ML model that predicts which house a student belongs to, based on their magical abilities, personality traits, and family history. Once done, the prediction probabilities will be encoded into a cipher that reveals the password to unlock the next Chamber of Data.
Dataset Description
    Source (synthetic/curated): Wizarding World Student Profiles Dataset (fictional but structured like a classification dataset).
    Structure: CSV file with ~2,000 records.
    Features:  courage_score, loyalty_score, wisdom_score, ambition_score (0–100)
               wand_length, wand_core_type, blood_status, pet_type
               quidditch_interest, dark_arts_defense_score
    Target Variable: house (4-class classification: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin).
    Complexity: Multi-class classification with both numerical and categorical features so it requires preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML modeling.
Expected Output
    A trained ML model that predicts the house assignment (multiclass classification).
    The probability scores (e.g., Gryffindor: 0.70, Ravenclaw: 0.20 …).
    Apply a custom transformation (Reed-Solomon error correction / Base64 / ASCII conversion) on the probability vector → generates a password string for the next         level of the treasure hunt.
Difficulty Level
    Intermediate
    Justification:
        Participants must handle categorical and  numerical features.
        Requires understanding of preprocessing (One-Hot Encoding, normalization).
        Involves building and tuning ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
        Added creative twist with encoding transformation before reaching the password.
